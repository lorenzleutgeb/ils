## Projects

### Prisma (in `Projects/prisma`)

An optimizing compiler that translates a logic language with standard connectives and quantification over finite domains into conjunctive normal form and interfaces with a solver (SAT4J).

### Hakuna Matata (in `Projects/hakuna_matata`)

A logic-based agent for *Hunt the Wumpus*.
